# AbzNNet - Abznak's Neural Network Library

## About
This library is intended to be used when you want to quickly add
neural network and/or evolutionary capabilities to a project.  

Just copy src/abznnet.cs to your project, 
    using Abznak.Evolve;
    using Abznak.NeuralNetwork;
then copy and modify a sample from src/samples/ or from src/TestAbzNNet.cs

It isn't intended to be used by others yet, but you're still welcome to use it
if you want to.
